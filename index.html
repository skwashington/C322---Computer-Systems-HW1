<h1>About Me:</h1>
<p>My name is Sade Washington, and I am a first-gen 4th year computer science student. I aspire to be a Data Scientist and have other computer science interests in the application of AI in language learning. I have previously worked with AI for language processing purposes.
    Aside from school, I like to learn about current events, hang with my kittyboys Kalibri and Times New Roman. I am the youngest of four girls, so family time is very important to me. I love to be outdoors whenever I can, walking trails in the winter to hiking and paddleboarding in the spring and summer.
