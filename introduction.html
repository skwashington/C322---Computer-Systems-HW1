        <td>Academically, my education has been mostly math and computer science, although I used my free electives in Spanish and Latin American Dances. I would consider my classes to be my "training" for technical interviews, although I do aspire to acquire certificates relevant to the field of Data Science.</td>
        <td>Professionally, I have acquired and built skills in LLMs, understanding and utilizing them to analyze their abilities. Aside from LLMs, I have dipped my toes in cybersecurity with phishing research and declassification.</td>
